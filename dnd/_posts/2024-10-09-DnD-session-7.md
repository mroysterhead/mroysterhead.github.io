# Session 7 - 10/9/24

- **Exploring the Cave**  
  - **Twowo** goes in first and gets his bell rung by falling rocks.

- **Findings**  
  - Discovered a document: a shipping manifest and schedule on **East Coast Trading Company** letterhead.  
    - Indicates a crate of apothecary items heading to **Rohandal University**.  
      - Contents include alchemist's fire, hooch, etc.
  - Found some nice clothes that **Grundle** takes an interest in.

- **Further Investigation**  
  - Uncovered a small, ironbound chest about the size of a lunchbox with an actual lunchbox inside.  
    - Feels quite heavy.

- **Teamwork**  
  - **Grundle** and **Grayvin** persuade a guy to help open the chest.  
    - Unsure what was inside, but they shared 5g each with the rest of us.

- **Aftermath**  
  - Left the guy behind for **Rellik** to cannibalize.  
    - **Tyler** wasn't present, so this has yet to be litigated.

- **Logistics**  
  - **Roland** looks for something to transport the loot and finds a handcart with two wheels, ideal for moving everything back.
