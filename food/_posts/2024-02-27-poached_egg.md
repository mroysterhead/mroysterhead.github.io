# Ingredients 
```
- Egg
- White vinegar
- Metal sieve 
- Large slotted spoon
```

# Procedure
 - create a small 1:1 water vinegar solution - About half a cup each for one egg
 - crack an egg into the solution, let it sit while the water comes up to temp
 - fill a shallow saucepan with enough water to cover the egg once you add the egg in. (We are not adding the egg yet)
 - You don't want to bring the water to a boil, about 150f should be enough
 - Once the water starts to form small bubbles at the bottom, strain the egg into the metal sieve. This will catch any loose strands of eggwhite. 
 - Gently drop the egg into the water. 
    - Some people swear by stirring the water first so the egg has a better chance to form near the center. I've had mixed results with this. If you are cooking a single egg, go for it. If you are cooking multiple, you can skip the stirring. 
 - Once the eggwhite looks opaque and firm stir the water to loosen it from the bottom and scoop it with the slotted spoon. 
 - Enjoy over toast, a pinch of salt and pepper to taste. 

 # Context
 If you ask five different people how to poach an egg you'll get five slightly different methods. This is a combination of techniques I learned from test kitchens of america as well as my own experimentation. I like my eggs with a fully cooked white and a jammy yolk. You may like yours more runny or more firm. Your mileage will vary. Do what works for you, but this method delivers consistently perfect poached eggs.
