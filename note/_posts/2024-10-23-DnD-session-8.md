# Session 8 - 10/23/24

- **Outside the cave**  
  - Standing outside the cave, loot in a wheelbarrow, Kissinger in hand.
  - On our way back.
- **Rellik offers Kissinger some jerky**, who is repulsed when he learns it’s made from human flesh.
  - Kissinger tries to put some distance between himself and Rellik, only to realize he is tethered.
  - Grundle reassures Kissinger, albeit not so delicately, that he will be fine.
- We have about a **day and a half of travel** ahead. So far, it’s been largely uneventful since leaving the cave.
- Eventually, we spot a **column of Rohandal guards** marching in step towards us.
  - Grundle attempts to obscure the fact that Kissinger is a prisoner by throwing a coat over his bound hands.
  - I notice the lead guard on horseback; soldiers march in lockstep, but everyone seems bored, as if it’s a mundane patrol.
  - A somewhat tense moment, but they continue walking past with their heavy armor clinking and clacking.

- We decide to **continue hiking through the night**.
  - Rellik hears people sneaking up on us and recognizes that they know Kissinger. They comment on how many people they’re up against.
  - Rellik immediately casts an **Infestation of maggots** on one of them, causing him to run screaming down the road.
  - They shout for Kissinger to run, but he’s immediately knocked down by (Joel).
  - Grundle puts a knife to Kissinger's neck and **demands the ambushers reveal themselves** (Nat 20 intimidation).
    - The man attacked by maggots surrenders, and we hear someone else running off into the woods.
    - The boys apprehend the man who surrendered, immediately strip and search him, finding about **40 copper** and a **scimitar**, which Roland takes.
    - (Joel) issues a warning to the man and sends him off into the woods, but not before Rellik says, "HEY HENRY, OPE, TWO FOR FLINCHING," and bloodies him before setting him loose.

- We arrive at the city just in time to see **the sun rising over the skyline**.
  - We deliver Kissinger to the town guard and hear them begin booking him.
  
- We return to **The Roost**.
  - Find Mandy having breakfast and ask about payment.
    - 30GP + 10GP bonus for capturing Kissinger alive. **6G50s per person**.
    - She comments on Roland's newly acquired sword and advises about a blacksmith who could fine-tune it. She demonstrates some flourishes of the blade before returning it.
